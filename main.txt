The purpose of this project/repository is not to write code but determine how to perform source control using github.
I'm now signed as cpijnenb (second account).

After adding 2 lines as cpijnenb and commiting the lines to the master branch as kpijnenb
I'm going to commit these changes too

Third chage by cpijnenb made to main.txt. stil using just the masterbranche.
Next test: save changes as new branch, cpijnenb (original created of the file/branch)

logged in as kpijnenb and working in the GitTest02 repository
still in the original (master) branch
